Catpcha is implemented as an input component with a built-in validator that is integrated with
reCaptcha. First thing to do is to sign up to reCaptcha to get public&private keys. Once you have
the keys for your domain, add them to web.xml as follows;

[source, xml]
----
<context-param>
    <param-name>primefaces.PRIVATE_CAPTCHA_KEY</param-name>
    <param-value>YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY</param-value>
</context-param>
<context-param>
    <param-name>primefaces.PUBLIC_CAPTCHA_KEY</param-name>
    <param-value>YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY</param-value>
</context-param>
----

That is it, now you can use captcha as follows:

[source, xml]
----
<p:captcha />
----

==== Themes
Captcha features light and dark modes for theme, light is the default one.

[source, xml]
----
<p:captcha theme="dark"/>
----

==== Languages
Text instructions displayed on captcha is customized with the _language_ attribute. Below is a captcha
with Turkish text.

[source, xml]
----
<p:captcha language="tr"/>
----

==== Overriding Validation Messages
By default captcha displays itâ€™s own validation messages, this can be easily overridden by the JSF
message bundle mechanism. Corresponding keys are:

- Summary: primefaces.captcha.INVALID
- Detail: primefaces.captcha.INVALID_detail

==== Tips

- Use label option to provide readable error messages in case validation fails.
- Enable _secure_ option to support https otherwise browsers will give warnings.
- See [http://www.google.com/recaptcha/learnmore](http://www.google.com/recaptcha/learnmore) to learn more about how reCaptcha works.
